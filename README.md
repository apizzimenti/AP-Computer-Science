These are the solutions to the Computer Science problems we've worked on throughout the year. Everything is written in Java, and 
even though there's a few applets in here and they aren't tested on the AP exam, they're very useful for web development.

There's a new branch for each unit of study because I want this to be somewhat organized instead of a random collection of solutions, 
so I might as well go over them here.

####Unit 1
Introductory Unit: syntax basics; constructor basics (default/parametric); multiple classes; learning the ``import`` statement

####Unit 2
Building on the Basics: calling methods from a driver class; parametric constructors; use of the ``Scanner`` class

####Unit 3
Logic and GUIs: introduction of the GUI using the ``javax.swing`` package; if statements, nested if statements; ``switch`` statements; 
some extended logic

####Unit 4
Loops: ``while``, ``do``, ``do while``, ``for``, and enhanced ``for`` loops

####Unit 5
Intro to Arrays: introduction of 1-D arrays and changing their values with ``for`` loops

####Unit 6
Extended Arrays and Sorting: introduction of the selection, insertion, quick, and merge sorting methods; introduction of the sequential 
and binary search methods; Big O; applying these methods to arrays

####Unit 7
2-D Arrays: generating mathematical models of the game of life, an election, and solving a system of equations using matrices

####Unit 8
Advanced Classes: using ``private``, ``static``, and ``final`` variable types; arraylists; reading from and writing to files;
